## Introduction
In this work, we propose a novel and easy-to-implement sampling strategy, coined Cross-Concentrated Sampling (CCS). Additionally, we propose a highly efficient non-convex algorithm, named Iterative CUR Completion (ICURC), for the proposed CCS model. More details can be found in our paper [1].
